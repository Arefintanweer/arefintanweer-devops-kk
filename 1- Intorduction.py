#Introduction
1. DevOps Pre-requisite
2. Java, Node, Python application basics
3. GIT
4. Containers
5. Docker
6. Kubernetes
7. YAML
8. Microservice Architecture
9. Ansible and Terraform
10. Python

#DevOps Tools
1. Develop application using IDE's 
2. Build the application using Maven/Gradle and make it        executable
3. Deploy the application to the physical server or VM 
4. Git and GitHub
5. Jenkins/GitHub Actions/Gitlab CI-CD to create CI/CD Pipeline : code automatically get pulled from the github repository to the build server and get built and then the executable automatically moved to the test server;then on successful testing it is automatically moved to the production server and deploy it.  build->test->deploy with lesser manual effort. Automate the build test and deploy process.
6. Container(Docker): Application needs dependencies. And these dependencies need to be installed in the server's too. Container help package the application and it's dependencies into an image that can then be run on any system. One of the containers tool is Docker.   
7. Containers orchrastration(Kubernetes): It is a Containers orchrastration platform. Run and maintain containers on the servers. It auto-scale the containers and Infrastructure.
8. Infrastructure as Code-IaC(Terraform): when a new server is created it needs to be configured and installed in the cluster. This is called provisioning. Terraform is the tool that automate the provisioning and configuration of servers;irrespective of which cloud platform they are on. 
9. Post provisioning automation(Ansible):used for Post configuration activities.    
10. Monitoring(Prometheus and Grafana) :prometheus collects data and grafana visualize them using charts/graphs.
